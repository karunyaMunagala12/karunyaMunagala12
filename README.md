# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Scientist with strong expertise in Software Development, Machine Learning, NLP, Big Data, and Data Analytics. Currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University of Southern California, I am passionate about solving real-world problems through machine learning and AI-driven solutions.

Throughout my career, I have gained hands-on experience working with data across various industries, including Healthcare, Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Consumer Data. My expertise spans machine learning model development, data analysis, and building scalable AI systems, giving me comprehensive knowledge of the data science lifecycle.

At EntreVita, I am working as a Machine Learning Scientist Intern, where I am architecting and fine-tuning machine learning models to improve meal recommendation accuracy, optimize system performance, and implement cutting-edge AI solutions for personalized nutrition.

My previous experience at Tata Consultancy Services allowed me to enhance semiconductor manufacturing processes by improving predictive accuracy using machine learning algorithms. I have also honed my skills in data processing, data security, and web scraping during my Data Analyst role at Rivan Solutions.
